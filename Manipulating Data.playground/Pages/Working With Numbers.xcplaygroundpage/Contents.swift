 ### Exercise: Working With Numbers
 
 Let's build a simple program to help a math student find out the result of multiplying two numbers.
 
 Define two constants, name them whatever you like, and assign two integers.
 */
// Enter your code here
let firstNumber: Int = 10
let secondNumber: Int = 20

//: Multiply the numbers and assign the result to a third constant
// Enter your code here
let result: Int = firstNumber * secondNumber
//: Define a string literal that describes the operation. Example: "The value of multiplying 10 by 20 is 200". Hint: Use string interpolation again to substitute the values.
// Enter your code here
let output: String = "The value of multiplying \(firstNumber) by \(secondNumber) is \(result)"
